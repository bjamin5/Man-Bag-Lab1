          <li>How can I  get a replacement buckle?</li>
            <p>Please contact us with your order ID and we will send a new buckle to you!</p>
          <li>I noticed that messenger bag is made of waterproof canvas and crazy horse leather, what is this crazy horse leather? </li>
            <p>Crazy horse leather, also known as saddle leather, is made by applying a special kind of wax to the already smooth,
              full grain leather surface. Wax enhances the fibers of the leather, and when they are scratched or
              rubbed, the natural color of the leather changes its hue and gives it an antique look.</p>
          <li>How big a water bottle can this hold? </li>
            <p>It basically depends upon what else you have in the bag. But you can put a nice big bottle in it.</p>
          <li>Does it hold a 16 inch laptop? </li>
            <p>16 should feel snuggled but should fit.</p>
          <li>Does the bag stain your clothes if it rubbers against them? Some leather bags do. </li>
            <p>I have been using this bag for several weeks now when wearing dress cloths
              (slacks, suits, white shirts, etc.). I haven't
              had a single problem with stains on my clothing.
              Bear in mind that I have yet to use it in the rain,
              but thus far I have had no problems at all with stains.</p>
          <li>Are the magnetic snaps strong enough to hold the bag closed when it's loaded up and you pick it
            up by the handle instead of the shoulder strap? </li>
            <p>
              I've been using the bag for several weeks taking it to work everyday.
              So far the magnetic snaps have held strong and have yet
              to open unintentionally.</p>
            <li>How Do You Wash It? </li>
              <p>Use a damp cloth.</p>
